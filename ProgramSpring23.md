# Spring 2023

The study group meets approximately every other Wednesday, from 14:00 to 15:00.

## 22. March
First meeting
How can digital tools be useful for our research?
What would we like to learn?

Please bring a brief description (a few sentences) of a project you are currently working on (in your research or teaching), with which you are curious about exploring the potential of using digital tools and methods. In addition to sharing ideas, in this first meeting, there will be a short introduction to a few ways in which using the programming language Python can be useful in theological and religious studies research. Remember to bring your laptop!

## 19. April
Part I of the project: "Creating a Database with PostgreSQL"

In the first meeting, we agreed to start working with PostgreSQL and to learn how to create and develop a database. We will do everything together, step-by-step, and everything we do will be documented, so that you can follow the progress without participating every time.  I will send out calendar invitations for all the dates shortly.

In preparation for the next meeting, please download the EDB PostgreSQL installer on your laptop from this site: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads, by choosing your operating system and the newest version of PostgreSQL (15.2), and complete the installation process.

If you are unsure about the installation process, there are many guides on how to install PostgreSQL online, here are short videos on how to do it for:
