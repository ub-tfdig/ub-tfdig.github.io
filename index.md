# TFDIG - The TF Study Group for Digital Research Methods

Welcome to the TFDIG website. The TFDIG Study Group usually meets every two weeks. The program for the study group and all progress we make will be documented here. In April 2023 we start working on the project "Creating a Database with PostgreSQL".
